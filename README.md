# [arXiv:2405.19049] Quantum Circuit Switching with One-Way Repeaters in Star Networks

The code in this repository was used to generate the results shown in our paper 'Quantum Circuit Switching with One-Way Repeaters in Star Networks' (arXiv:2307.01406). The paper was accepted and presented at the IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering 2024 (QCE24).

File overview:
 - `QCSsimulator.py`: main functions used to simulate a star network running a quantum circuit switching protocol.
 - `PAPER-*.ipynb`: notebooks used to generate all the results shown in the paper.
 - `VALIDATION-*.ipynb`: notebooks used to validate the analytical solutions and approximations derived in the paper, comparing them to simulation results.
